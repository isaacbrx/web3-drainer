# web3-drainer

🚀 **Visual showcase of Web3 deployment logic & NFT simulation page**

This project presents a preview of a custom `deploy.js` script designed for EVM contract deployment and a front-end NFT bait page used in controlled behavioral testing. It's built as part of blockchain automation and cybersecurity research efforts.

## 🧠 What’s Included

- `deploy.js` — logic for gas-tuned contract deployment, RPC fallback, and wallet interaction  
- NFT bait page — a static HTML/CSS simulation used in testing wallet response behavior

🛡️ No exploit code is published. This repo is for educational or research preview only.
